  First blog post that roughly describes the goals of the organization. Divided on three pillars,
  I see possibilities where FridaysForFuture can be helped and where a little bit can be found against climate change.

                  One would think "The IT department, this is the future, there are no starting points to do anything about climate change".
                  But this is a misbelief. In addition to the major social tasks, each and every industry must question itself. Reality seems different:

                Der Energiebedarf von Rechenzentren in Deutschland liegt momentan ungefähr bei 10 bis 15 TWh. In CO2-Äquivalente umgerechnet,
                entspricht das ungefähr den CO2-Emissionen, die wir im Flugverkehr in Deutschland haben.

                  These figures need to be checked and refined. If one reads the large number, then here is a large lever, where one can make a large
                  contribution by savings or by 100% renewable energies. I see it as a refinement that every developer,
                  every IT company but also every user can make a contribution here. <br />
                  Together with the fact that we mostly like Open-Soure in software development,
                  the following three pillars result, which we can see as a guideline for our work at DevelopersForFuture.

                <h3>1. Support of FridaysForFuture</h3>
                <p>
                  There is already a small team of students who form a software team within the FridaysForFuture organization.
                  Together they make sure that the website runs and help to set up tools that help the organization as a whole to come together and make decisions.<br />
                  But there is also a badarf of support, as there are many ideas how FridaysForFuture can be supported by small tools of its own.
                  The aim is to build up the democratic process within and above all to make it fast. Groups about Facebook and the tools bound in
                  it turned out already at the beginning of the year as not helpful. That's why it's important to set up your own tools here.
                  The whole thing should of course be done hand in hand with your own developers. But there can also be some support via point 2 (Education).
                </p>
                <h4>Proposals for cooperation</h4>
                <p>
                  As software developers we are accustomed to working on clearly defined tasks on a ticket board. At least you can force better and more focused results. Of course, there are also procedures in this segment that could speed up or channel this work, but I assume that we are developers with different backgrounds at the beginning. That's why I'd like to make the following proposal:
                  <ul>
                    <li>We make sure that we can discuss the ideas and wishes of FridaysForFuture globally in issues on Github. I have already created a single repository including issues and project board. -</li>
                    <li>Together with contact persons at FriddaysForFuture, we discuss the implementation and hold short feedback loops to discuss this implementation again and again.</li>
                    <li>Each project is maintained on Github as a public project with the idea of open source, which means it also gets an open source license (that means that internal data is not accessible in a public place). </li>
                    <li>We take care of the respective infrastructure and its procurement.</li>
                    <li>By appointing a maintainer, problems and new requirements are also tackled after completion.</li>
                    <li>Weekly votes of the developers of DevelopersForFuture ensure the greatest possible transparency and exchange of experience. Establishment of a joint chat provides for short-term exchange.</li>
                    <li>All these points can be questioned and adapted at any time.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                  With the first of three pillars I try to roughly suggest an idea approach. More important than the rules is the common goal and working together.
                  That's why we shouldn't be so much concerned with questions about choosing the right programming language,
                  but should simply start where each individual feels most comfortable. <br />
                  There's plenty to do. And together we can create a community that takes the climate a significant step further.

                  Of course, that was only one of three points. That's why this post can be seen as the start of a series.
                  The next one will be about the possibilities of education or training that we can provide through our work.
                  In the last post we will focus on our efforts for a more sustainable software development.
