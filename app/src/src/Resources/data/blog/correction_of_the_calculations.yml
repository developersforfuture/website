                  After my talk yesterday at the "Rooftop Brains & BBQ" I had to go over my
                  calculations again. And yes, there was a mistake in the ten digits.
                  In addition, there are now new factors for calculating the CO² consumption for one unit of electricity.
                </p>
                <img src="/img/blog/correction_of_the_calculations/Faktor_CO2.jpg" title="Evolution of factor to calculate CO2 per Energy unit.">
                <p>
                  Based on the factor, we can then take the consumption from it and calculate a value for the CO² Footprint for 2018.
                </p>
                <img src="/img/blog/correction_of_the_calculations/calculation_1.png" title="Correct calculation">
                <p>
                  You can now see the numbers shown in the slides, or at least the numbers that should be shown.
                  We now have a CO2 footprint of 26 million tonnes.
                  This corresponds to 130000000000 km with a VW Golf 4.692 Mio. €
                  if we had a CO2 tax of 180 € per ton.
                <p>
                <p>
                  Of course I would also offer the link to the slides with the corrected numbers here:
