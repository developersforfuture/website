# persistence is configured through propagation of core-bundle's configuration: https://symfony.com/doc/current/cmf/bundles/core/configuration.html#persistence
# So core-bundle, menu-bundle, block-bundle and routing bundle can be configured on their own too. Have a look at:
# menu-bundle: https://symfony.com/doc/current/cmf/bundles/menu/configuration.html
# block-bundle: https://symfony.com/doc/current/cmf/bundles/block/configuration.html
# content-bundle: https://symfony.com/doc/current/cmf/bundles/content/configuration.html
# routing-bundle: https://symfony.com/doc/current/cmf/bundles/routing/configuration.html
# for their specific configuration
